# Part I: OpenMuse offering


---

## Topics

- <p style="font-size:80%">WP1 Slovak creators, including music creators, should earn as much as the European average. Their income should level up to German and Finnish levels.</p>

- <p style="font-size:80%">WP2 Slovak people should find good Slovak music in Lithuania on Spotify, YouTube and the radio. Foreign labels must not increase their market share and colonize the local creative ecosystem.</p>

- <p style="font-size:80%">WP3 Correctly attributing the environmental and social benefits (and costs) of music.</p>

- <p style="font-size:80%">WP4 Making sure that big data and AI works for all. Tap into open data, linked open data, bring the creative sectors to the web 3.0.</p>

## AI & Data Policies
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></br></br></br></br>
---

## Trustworthy AI, trustworthy data in culture

- Is the algorithm cheating? ➡️ trustworthy AI policy, enabling courts, competition and consumer protection agencies to protect the Slovak CCIs
- Is the algorithm learning from bad data? ➡️  national heritage policy, consolidate Slovak CCI data as linked, open data, and sync it daily with the world.
- Can we ask for 20% Slovak music in radio, television, YouTube or Spotify?

---

```
Topics: 
 - European AI regulation and ethics, music AI, 
 - non-discriminiation and fair remuneration for 
 Slovakia's creators.
 - Smart and future proof local content and media 
 regulation, music export, cultural heritage. 

Features: 
 - The policy brief itself expressed as a resource, 
   not a static file that is once finished and downloaded.
 - It is an educational document in itself, it is 
 self-refreshing with data, legal and policy texts
 - We educate policy-makers and music professionals
 to talk, write and think about AI in a smart way.

---

## Indicators: example

- Type and extent of side jobs among Slovak musicians
- Average number of copyright protected works and neighboring rights protected recordings per musician

---

## Indicators: side job

- Define a side job. Develop a strategy to ask or measure it correctly.
- Characterize the side job (which other [creative] industry has the performance)
- Divide it with the correct number of musicians.

---

## Indicators: copyrights

- Define a musician.  What type of intellectual property a musician has?
- Develop a strategy to ask/measure the number of works/recordings per musician.
- Develop a strategy to count/measure number of musicians.
- Divide works/recordings with the number of musicians

---

## Who shall we ask?

- We would like to involve all relevant policy stakeholders: ministry, parliament, NGOs, government organizations
- The Open Policy Analysis allows the involvement of citizens, individual experts, small organizations.
