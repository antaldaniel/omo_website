|<p style="font-size:70%">üßæ  We implement with Eviota the new reporting and accounting standards of EFRAG. We connect a reliable benchmark to every accounting item and make sure that your financial accounts contain your GHG footprint or even your contribution to equal pay for womxn. This will help you gain cheaper green loans, insurance, or green transition subsidies.</p>|

# Big Data Creates Inequalities

Only the largest corporations, best-endowed universities, and rich governments can afford data collection and processing capacities that are large enough to harness the advantages of AI.

## Data problems

| <div style="width:200px"></div>  |   |
|---|:--|
|<img src="difficulty_bills_levels.jpg" height="130"> | <p style="font-size:65%">The cost of questionnaire-based market research (survey) is increasing exponentially and offers mediocre results without an enormous question bank and harmonization with other surveys.(See [üñ± blogpost](https://reprex.nl/data/surveys/)) </p> |
|<img src="photo-1490004047268-5259045aa2b4.jpg" height="130"> | <p style="font-size:65%">Manual data acquisition is an error-prone and boring task for humans that requires many working hours (often not credited in consultancies, law firms, or research institutes.)</p> |
|<img src="Sisyphus_Bodleian_Library.png"  height="130"> | <p style="font-size:65%">Wrangling spreadsheet tables or word processor documents by people without data knowledge is the [üñ± data Sisyphus](https://reprex.nl/post/2021-07-08-data-sisyphus/).</p> |

## Data observatories 3.0

<p style="font-size:90%">Reprex is offering shared data ecosystems. Our observatories are great solutions for organizations without a data specialization:</p>

| | 
|:--|
|<p style="font-size:75%">üå≥ Organizations that cannot afford to build a large enough data team to sustain consistent, extensive data collection and processing (many large institutions and companies)</p>|
|<p style="font-size:75%">ü™¥  Who cannot hire even a single data engineer or a data scientist (medium-sized companies, NGOs)</p>|
|<p style="font-size:75%">üå± Who do not even have a permanent IT function (about 2 million European small enterprises and civil society organizations)</p>|

|<img src="observatory_collage_3x2_800.png" height="140"> | <p style="font-size:60%">The European Union, the World Bank, OECD, and UN have facilitated the creation of more than 80 so-called 'data observatories' to help companies, researchers, NGOs, and governments systematically collect data and knowledge.</p> |
|<img src="dmo_opening_page_20220920_16x9.png" height="140"> | <p style="font-size:60%">We are currently building one prototype for the European Music Observatory financed by the European Union and music industry players (cc 3-4 million euros.)  We would like to take over existing or start new observatories in 2 years at least 5)</p> |
|<img src="gold_panning_slide_notitle.png" height="140"> | <p style="font-size:60%">Our observatories are competitive, because they use high-quality open source scientific software; they exploit the new Data Governance Act and Open Data Directive, deploy web 3.0 data synchronization, and offer great value-added research products.</p> |

|---|---|
|<p style="font-size:65%">The European Union, the World Bank, OECD, and UN have facilitated the creation of more than 80 so-called 'data observatories' to help companies, researchers, NGOs, and governments systematically collect data and knowledge.</p>| <p style="font-size:65%">The different observatories offer different types of knowledge products, such as statistical yearbooks, various apps, and database access.</p>|
|<p style="font-size:65%">Most of them use web 1.0 technologies, inefficient knowledge accumulation.  Already 20 of them have been discontinued.| <p style="font-size:65%">We are developing software solutions that exploit our platforms: we harmonize surveys, statistical data, automate research reporting, elements of market monitoring or ESG reporting.</p>|
|<p style="font-size:65%"> We are currently building one prototype for the European Music Observatory financed by the European Union and music industry players (cc 3-4 million euros.)  We would like to take over existing or start new observatories  in 2 years at least 5) </p>| <p style="font-size:65%">Each observatory gives us intimidate customer access to 3-4 large universities, 1-2 large consultancies, and various specialist institutions. </p>|

| <img src="reprex_contributors_20220920_2_1.png" width="200"> |  <p style="font-size:65%">The two co-founders, [üñ± Daniel Antal, CFA](https://reprex.nl/authors/daniel_antal/) and [üñ± Andr√©s Garc√≠a Molina, PhD](https://reprex.nl/authors/andres/), and the core team manage the ecosystems' development, develop knowledge management, and direct the software development. [üñ± Team on full screen](https://reprex.nl/#team)</p>  |
| <img src="dmo_contributors_20220920_2_1.png" width="200"> | <p style="font-size:65%">Each observatory has a broader team of users, data and knowledge curators, and developers. The most developed [üñ±Ô∏è Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/#contributors) has 16 institutional users and a team of about 20 music and data professionals. The newer observatories have a smaller, initial service development and data curatorial team.</p>  |
