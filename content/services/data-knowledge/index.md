title: "Data Curators, Stewards & Strategists"
summary: We aim to provide the template of a better knowledge infrastructure (accessible for both humans and their intelligent software agents), better governance to connect many reliable but small data sources, and to automate data collection, processing, validation and dissemination. We strive to be the best curated, efficient, and value-for-money observatory globally and the first to integrate official statistical and private data programs.

We have reviewed over 60 EU and UN-recognised, even private observatories, i.e., permanent data collection programs in natural and social sciences and digital humanities. We aim to provide the template of a better knowledge infrastructure (accessible for both humans and their intelligent software agents), better governance to connect many reliable but small data sources, and to automate data collection, processing, validation and dissemination. We strive to be the best curated, efficient, and value-for-money observatory globally and the first to integrate official statistical and private data programs. Running only on open-source components,  we hope that our "automated observatory platform" will be reused in humanities, social and natural sciences, too.
