summary: We want to fill the perceived data gaps in the music sector as identified by the Feasibility study for the establishment of the European Music Industry and go beyond to find actionable benchmarks and targets for the triple transition, including the five environmental areas and four social sustainability areas of the new European Sustainability Reporting Standards.

We want to fill the perceived data gaps in the music sector as identified by the Feasibility study for the establishment of the European Music Industry and go beyond to find actionable benchmarks and targets for the triple transition, including the five environmental areas and four social sustainability areas of the new `European Sustainability Reporting Standards`. We want to show how statistical innovation allows a two-way integration of publicly and privately held data, in line with the `European Data Strategy`. From May 2024, we will publish Pan-European indicators and novel, innovative, in-depth indicators that can be replicated in any EU/EEA/candidate country that harmonises its practice with EU standards.
