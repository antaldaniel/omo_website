We help business and academic research with data  and reproducible research applications (for collecting, processing, validating, testing, and visualising data and bibliographic sources.)  Our `Digital Music Observatory` is curating global question banks and data repositories to harmonise your survey questionnaires with pre-existing ones, provide a history and international benchmark for your research questionnaire, or boost your data sample. 

We build a knowledge platform to synchronise data, publications, and catalogues with other knowledge centres such as Wikidata/Wikipedia, national libraries, MusicBrainz,  knowledge graphs of digital streaming providers, and statistical agencies. We want to be the platform that publishes your guidelines and booklets in a way that the world's music and policy libraries place them into their catalogues and re-post your blog posts in a way that a wider audience reaches them. We are still building, but we can boost the visibility and reach of your publications or provide you with data you have never seen. 

We give an ISBN and/or DOI to your finished publications and ensure that they get in front of the relevant audiences and into the proper repositories and libraries of the world. We can help measure impact, too.
