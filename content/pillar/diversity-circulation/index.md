# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary: "Music diversity and circulation is a crucial policy and business goal for European music stakeholders. Most European creators work in small countries, often confined to the audiences of a not widely spoken language; moreover, they are in competition with the entire world via media platforms, streaming services and traditional record sales."

WP2 Music diversity and circulation will culminate in a pilot project conducted in Slovakia, Lithuania, and Ukraine by [SOZA](/authors/soza), [MXF](/authors/mxf), and [MEU](/authors/meu). 

The WP2 pilot project will demonstrate the feasibility of increasing local artist
representation in radio and streaming, via trustworthy AI and evidence-based regulatory policy. In the “Listen Local” project, partners [SOZA](/authors/soza) and [Reprex](/authors/reprex) created the Slovak Demo Music Database (SDMDb) as a reference database to measure the market share of Slovak music in radio and streaming, and created a prototype of a recommendation
system that meets trustworthy AI criteria and is able to achieve similar cultural diversity goals as laid out by Slovak media legislation in 2015: i.e., to achieve 15% “Slovak” market share in radio playlists.

The WP2 pilot project will complete the SDMDb with GDPR-compliant write-in, opt-in, and opt-out mechanisms piloted with [SOZA](/authors/soza) in Slovakia. The SCMDb will be harmonised (upon rightsholder approval) with [SOZA](/authors/soza)’s databases about all Slovak music works, as well as open-source music databases (e.g., MusicBrainz and Wikipedia artist pages). This will serve as a reference database to measure the market share of Slovak music within Slovak radio play, using [SOZA](/authors/soza)’s collective management system for public performance – as well as within streaming, using the big data sampling software contained within the OpenMusE music data software ecosystem. Based on the SDMDb, the Consortium will create a Ukrainian Comprehensive Music Database as write-in systems that can be actualised, upon request, by Lithuanian and Ukrainian CMOs, using our open-source, user-friendly data collection software and tools. These databases and reports will be created in accordance with Open Policy Analysis and open-source scientific software development standards, which means the Consortium will be able to scale up our market share reporting to any EU member state in which a CMO provides consent for data access.

We will address diversity issues with recycled and harmonized surveys.
