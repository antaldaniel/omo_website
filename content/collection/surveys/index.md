## Music Professionals 2023

The survey will help decision makers assess royalty distribution, among other key aspects of working life in the music industry. Below are some details about how your responses are stored and used.

**Types of data collected**: This survey includes questions about your musical activities, recordings, live performances, works and lyrics, and sources of income. We will also ask some basic questions about you (e.g., age, gender identity, attitudes toward life). Some answers are required, but for most questions, you are free not to answer if you prefer.

**Privacy and data security**: This survey is anonymous: no personally identifiable information is collected. You will not be asked to provide your name or contact information. The computer assisted survey will be carried out with SurveyMonkey, a global survey platform of Momentive Europe UC. SurveyMonkey does collect IP addresses which will be stored to trance potential vandalism or misuse, but this information will be detached from the analyzed files. We make sure that no responses can be traced back to a respondent. 

**Purpose of data collection**: The data will be analysed by the SurveyHarmonies and [Open Music Europe](/project/openmusiceurope/) project partners. The aggregated and anonymised findings will be reported to the funding agencies, and published in English on the [Digital Music Observatory website](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), as well as in scientific articles and policy briefs. Selected findings will also be published in multiple European languages by local music stakeholders, for example by [Artisjus](/authors/artisjus/) (in Hungarian), [Musicautor](/authors/musicautor/) (in Bulgarian) and [SOZA](/authors/soza/) (in Slovak). Our hope is that the findings will empower stakeholders to work together to raise standards in the industry across Europe.

**Data access**: Only statistically aggregated data will be reported to the Open Music Europe project partners. The data controllers provide microdata access to statistical researchers who adhere to strict ethical principles. For scientific replicability and reviewability, we provide access to subsets of the data for quality control or statistical research purposes. 

**Data controllers**: [SINUS Markt- und Sozialforschung GmbH](/authors/sinus/) and [Reprex bv](/authors/reprex/).
