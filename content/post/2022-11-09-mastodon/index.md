`eupolicy.social` is a Mastodon instance for the EU policy bubble. Its aim is to provide a friendly and respectful discussion space for people working in the field of EU policy and to contribute to the health, diversity and growth of the fediverse—the federation of decentralized social media that share an open protocol. We chose this server because we hope that the European music business, research and policy stakeholders will take ownership of the our observatory, and will make it _the_ European Music Observatory.

If you use any Mastodon, or any federated, open social media, you can engage with our `@digitalmusicobs@eupolicy.social` profile, no matter who you are, no matter what you do—as long you abide to a respectful tone and a rational dialogue, in other terms, you abide by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

The advantage of a decentralized social media is that no single company or person, can impose their will on the whole system or shut it all down. If an extremist voice emerged with their own server, it would be easy enough for other servers to cut ties with it, leaving it to talk to its own followers and users, and without bothering us.

We love {{< icon name="twitter" pack="fab" >}} Twitter, but it was purchased by an eccentric billionaire with a political agenda who took it private. We want to make sure that we have a more secure, more ethical alternative, in case things go wrong with that platform.
