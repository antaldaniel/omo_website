## Europeana

The portal is a central point of access to European open data from international, European Union, national, regional, local and geodata portals. It consolidates the former EU Open Data Portal and the European Data Portal.

The Open Music Observatory is going to publish collections on Europeana. Collections are curated video or audio music sound recordings, digitised music sheets, photographs and other artefacts of our shared European music heritage, accompanied by rich metadata about the works, performers and composers.

## Collections

The Open Music Observatory works with representative music institutions' collections; in this case, the observatory technically facilitates passing enriched and correct information about the collection to Europeana Sound at the British Library. In this case, the collections (and the datasets representing these music collections) follow their curatorial policies that we do not influence; the collections will be attributed to the Observatory Stakeholder Network member whose collection is aggregated to Europeana.

For smaller collections, such as the repertoires of small labels, orchestras, bands, and individual artists, the Open Music Observatory strategically leverages OpenCollections, our sister project, and aligns with its curatorial policies. This experimental offering is invitation-only, but we are happy to discuss additions.


## Data

The dataset must contain catalogue information of the collection, accompanied by thumbnail images and URL links to the digital assets (audio or video sound recordings, still images, text)  that can be viewed free and without password protection with no significant restrictions. For example, they may contain YouTube or Vimeo URLs but not URLs of streaming services that require an account to listen to the music. 

The dataset must contain at least the mandatory fields of the Europeana Data Model. 

## Metadata 

Europeana publishes the metadata in Turtle serialisation. The Open Music Observatory will provide access to the metadata in TTL and CSV distributions.
