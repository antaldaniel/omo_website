You can find our datasets on [https://data.europa.eu/data/catalogues/open-music-observatory/](https://data.europa.eu/data/catalogues/open-music-observatory/).

## Data

Each dataset is provided with different `distributions`, for example, a separate downloadable version in `.csv` or `.sav` file.

## Metadata 

The metadata can be downloaded in various RDF serialisations.

## data.europa.eu

The portal is a central point of access to European open data from international, European Union, national, regional, local and geodata portals. It consolidates the former EU Open Data Portal and the European Data Portal.

The portal is intended to:

- [x] give access and foster the reuse of European open data among citizens, business and organisations.

- [x] promote and support the release of more and better-quality metadata and data by the EUâ€™s institutions, agencies and other bodies, and European countries, enhancing the transparency of European administrations.

- [x] educate citizens and organisations about the opportunities that arise from the availability of open data.

It is funded by the EU and managed operationally by the Publications Office of the European Union in cooperation with the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology of the European Commission, responsible for EU open data policy.

We publish our data primarily on the EU open data portal for statistically processed datasets (datasets that contain the generalised characteristics of many data subjects without personal data that could identify them).
