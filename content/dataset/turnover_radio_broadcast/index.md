Imputed and forecasted values of  the radio broadcasting industry from the Annual detailed enterprise statistics for services (NACE Rev. 2 H-N and S95) Eurostat folder.

We use backcasting, forecasting, approxmation, last observation carry forward and next observation carry backwards to impute missing values, and to create realistic forecasts up to three periods. 

Compared to the Eurostat raw data we added value with    
Increased number of observations: 65%
Reduced missing values: -48.1%
Increased non-missing subset for regression or AI: +66.67%
