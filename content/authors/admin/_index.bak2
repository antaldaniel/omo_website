The `Digital Music Observatory` is a  prototype of an open, decentralised, reproducible research-supported data observatory that follows the _Feasibility Study for establishing a European Music Observatory_.  High-quality indicators and databases are being developed, consulted with the industry, produced and added to the Digital Music Observatory web resource in various public and private projects. The platform is being developed by Reprex, and the four main Data Pillars by the Open Music Europe project.
