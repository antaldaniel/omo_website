The `Open Music Observatory` is a digital service provider for the music industry that follows the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) definition for such services with a unique governance model. The governance model and the digital service infrastructure represent a unique innovation that considers many good examples from the European Union and other industries.

Creating the `Open Music Observatory` is a cornerstone task of the [OpenMusE](/authors/openmuse) Horizon Europe research and innovation project. This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon Europe, research and innovation programme, under Grant Agreement No. [101095295](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101095295). (See further [disclaimer](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/documentation/#disclaimer-of-warranties)) This document has been prepared by Open Music Europe (OpenMusE) project partners as an account of work carried out within the framework of this contract. Our prototype is following the  _Feasibility Study for establishing a European Music Observatory_. As an early prototype, it is not recognised by the European Commission or any international organisations.
