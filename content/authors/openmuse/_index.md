`OpenMusE` brings together music industry stakeholders and researchers from 10 EU countries and Ukraine[^1]. Our consortium recognises that placing European music ecosystems on a more competitive, fair, and sustainable footing requires evidence-based policymaking, business planning and accuracy. We provide the data needed for these actions.
I have more  to say.

[^1]: The OpenMusE project ends on 31 December 2025; the Open Music Observatory is going to operate beyond the timescale of this research and innovation action.

Using transparent methods and tools, `OpenMusE` maps the policy as well as the data landscape. The project bridges data gaps and empowers stakeholders and policymakers to take data-driven actions. Our project is grounded on principles of open policy analysis, open science, and open-source software development. We work with stakeholders to identify data gaps on the EU, national, and regional levels; co-create indicators and methods for bridging them; develop free software tools for data collection and analysis; and report our findings and every step taken to reach them.

Using the `Open Music Observatory` and our open-source software, music SMEs without technical departments or expertise will be able to access and analyse open data; model volume and value, including of zero-price uses; create better business models; and generate corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports; all at a fraction of current costs. We validate these tools in four pilot studies that will bring concrete benefits to stakeholders within the project lifespan.

_This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon Europe, research and innovation programme, under Grant Agreement No. [101095295](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101095295)._
