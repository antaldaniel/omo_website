The Observatory Stakeholder Network is a temporary organisation defined by the Open Music Europe project Consortium Agreement. It is an observatory volunteer advisory body.

We will invite every organisation that has promised data for a future European Music Observatory or has shown interest in the previous CEEMID or Digital Music Observatory collaborations to join our network. In the longer term, we envision some pan-European representative and umbrella organisations becoming founders or board members in the more permanent observatory organisation. For individuals, research groups, and micro-enterprises, we will suggest setting up the European Music Observatory Network Association (or similar entity), learning from the experience of Europeana.
