The next development phase of this observatory will be critical: we must persuade music sector stakeholders to trust and use our system for data sharing well beyond the stakeholders of the [Open Music Europe](/authors/openmuse) project. 

{{< cta cta_text="Contact" cta_link="https://reprex.nl/contact/" cta_new_tab="false" cta_alt_text="Requested data about applicants" cta_alt_link="https://music.dataobservatory.eu/documentation/obstakeholdernetwork.html" cta_alt_new_tab="false" >}}

We would like to agree on a governance model that allows the extensions and the ownership transfer of this `Open Music Observatory` to a truly European, shared, public-private observatory that can serve the music sector for a long time.
